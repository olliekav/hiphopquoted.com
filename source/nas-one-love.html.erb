      What up kid? I know shit is rough doing your bid
      When the cops came you should have slid to my crib
      Fuck it black, no time for looking back it's done
      Plus congratulations, you know you got a son
      I heard he looks like ya, why don't your lady write ya?
      Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
      Flipping, talking 'bout he acts too rough
      He didn't listen he be riffing while I'm telling him stuff
      I was like yeah, shorty don't care, she a snake too
      Fucking with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you
      But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
      Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach
      It's bugged, plus little Rob is selling drugs on the dime
      Hanging out with young thugs that all carry nines
      And night time is more trife than ever
      What up with Cormega, did you see him, are y'all together?
      If so then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
      Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
      I left a half a hundred in your commissary
      You was my nigga when push came to shove, one what? (One love)
    %p
      Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
      Out in New York the same shit is going on
      The crackheads stalking, loudmouths is talking
      Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walking
      That nigga you shot last year tried to appear
      Like he hurting something, word to mother, I heard him fronting
      And he be pumping on your block, your man gave him your Glock
      And now they run together, what up son, whatever
      Since I'm on the streets I'mma put it to a cease
      But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
      Wilding on the Island, but now in Elmira
      Better chill cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
      Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
      But maintain when you come home the corner's ours
      On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal
      When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
      But chill, see you on the next V-I
      I gave your ma duke's loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
      Your brother's buckwilding in 4-Main, he wrote me
      He might beat his case, 'til he come home, play it low key
      So stay civilized, time flies
      Though incarcerated your mind die, I hate it when your moms cries
      It kinda wants to make me murder, for reala
      I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs but one love
    %p
      Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
      Mind's in another world thinking how can we exist through the facts
      Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera
      Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
      So I be ghost from my projects, I take my pen and pad
      For the weekend hittin L's while I'm sleeping
      A two day stay, you may say I need the time alone
      To relax my dome, no phone, left the nine at home
      You see the streets had me stressed something terrible
      Fucking with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue
      Or HDM, hit with numbers from 8 to 10
      A future in a maximum state pen is grim
      So I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop
      Rolling two phillies together in the Bridge we called 'em oo-wops
      He said "Nas, niggas cold be busting off the roof
      So I wear a bullet proof and pack a black trey-deuce"
      He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
      Started coughing, one eye peeked to watch me speak
      I sat back like The Mack, my army suit was black
      We was chilling on these benches where he pumped his loose cracks
      I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard
      Keeps me blasted and starts talking mad shit
      I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
      Cause when the pistol blows the one that's murdered be the cool one
      Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up
      Coulda caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
      Mistakes happen, so take heed never bust up
      At the crowd catch him solo, make the right man bleed
      Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul
      Only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style
      Then I rose, wiping the blunt's ash from my clothes
      Then froze only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
      And told my little man I'mma go [???]
      Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
      Words of wisdom from Nas: try to rise up above
      Keep an eye out for Jake, Shorty Wop, one love
