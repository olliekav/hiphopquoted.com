      Electromagnetic beam, I get charged
      Rhymes I run right thru em like a big box of Trojan large
      Mc's tried to hang but its a Brooklyn thang
      Poison slang, poison fang
      Poison pen let me begin
      Tryin to rhyme up in my cipher is gambilin
      Freestylin me g, I be buckwilin
      You can't even challenge a nigga in my position
      Technician, renditions more freaky than Rick James
      Fly like airplanes thru all it remain the same
      My cuts like Freddy Krueger
      Dont need a German Luger
      But shoot more shit than Sturm-Ruger
      Dirty rottens comin thru punks cling to their guns
      Dont start none, there won't be none
      Cuz ahh...fuck around and it'll be tragic
    %p
      Devastating, I gotcha heart pulsating
      Kool-Aid, you need aid, ejaculating
      Rhymes like semen, Mc's is scheming
      Tryin to bag me baby black you must be beemin...
      Feenin, I dont know who gased ya head up
      Im straight up, for less niggas have got wet up
      Im on a mission, scrambling my enemies transmission
      When he least expect it, run up in his h-q
      Hi I.Q., every verse is e-q ued
      Slither like a snake, still you can't elude
      The neba, but not caneza
      Its the toucha, no gun or God can protect ya
      Neither the scripture, choke like a boa constrictor
      This is my house and I'll evict ya
      Big respect is automatic...black
    %p
      I'll snatch up your girlfriend, her friend and their friends
      I got the game & fame she got the condoms
      She's a victim, you shouldn't have that mouth dirty rotten
      And for the longest we knew you were plottin'
      On the down fall, who stands tall, lick the balls
      Im not like that, so I smash out pussy walls
      On the low, oh no, on the high
      I get high, praise to the most high
      Tried to battle me, step up & die
      Like the arc of the covenant I electrify
      Petrify, intelligence I glorify
      So devils are horrified
      Sprayin like pesticide, come commit suicide
      Step into my realm and be fried
      By the statik.........
