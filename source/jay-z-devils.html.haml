      This shit is wicked on these mean streets
      None of my friends speak, we're all tryna win but then again
      Maybe it's for the best though cause when they're saying too much
      You know they're trying to get you touched
      Whoever said illegal was the easy way out, couldn't understand
      The mechanics and the workings of the underworld, granted
      Nine to five is how to survive, I ain't trying to survive
      I'm tryna live it to the limit and love it a lot
      Life ills poisoned my body
      I used to say fuck mic skills, I never prayed to God, I prayed to Gotti
      That's right it's wicked, that's life I live it
      Ain't asking for forgiveness for my sins, ends
      I break bread with the late heads
      Picking their brains for angles on, all the evils that the game'll do
      It gets dangerous, money and power is changing us
      And now we're lethal, infected with D'evils
    %p
      We used to fight for building blocks
      Now we fight for blocks with buildings that make a killing
      The closest of friends when we first started
      But grew apart as the money grew and soon grew black-hearted
      Thinking back when we first learned to use rubbers
      He never learned so in turn I'm kidnapping his baby's mother
      My hand around her collar, feeding her cheese
      She said the taste of dollars was shitty so I fed her fifties
      About his whereabouts I wasn't convinced
      I kept feeding her money 'til her shit started to make sense
      Who could ever foresee, we used to stay up all night
      At slumber parties, now I'm tryna rock this bitch to sleep
      All the years we were real close, now I see his fears
      Through her tears know she's wishing we were still close
      Don't cry, it is to be, in time
      I'll take away your miseries and make it mine, D'evils
    %p
      My flesh, no nigga could test, my soul is possessed
      By D'evils in the form of diamonds and Lexuses
      The Exorcist, got me doing sticks like "homie
      You don't know me but the whole world owe me, strip!"
      Was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fucking life
      So now I'm down for whatever ain't nothing nice
      Throughout my junior high years it was all friendly
      But now this higher learning got the Remy in me
      Liquor's invaded my kidneys
      Got me ready to lick off, mama forgive me
      I can't be held accountable, D'evils beating me down, boo
      Got me running with guys making G's, telling lies that sound true
      Come test me, I never cower
      For the love of money, son, I'm giving lead showers
      Stop screaming, you know the demon said it's best to die
      And even if Jehovah witness, bet he'll never testify, D'evils
