      Let me freak the funk
      Obsolete is the punk that talk more junk than Sanford sells
      I jet propel at a rate that complicate their mental state
      As I invade their masquerade
      They couldn't fade with a clipper blade
      10 years in the trade is not enough, you can't cut it
      I let you take a swing, and you bunted
      For an easy out, I leave emcees with doubt
      Of exceeding, my name is Bootie Brown and I'm proceeding, leading
      They try to follow but they're shallow and hollow
      I can see right through them like an empty 40 bottle, of O.E
      They have no key, or no clue
      To the game at all, now they washed up
      Hung out to dry
      Standing looking stupid, wondering why
      (why man?)
      It was the fame, that they tried to get
      Now they walking around talkin about represent
      And keep it real, but I got to appeal
      Cause they existing in a fantasy when holding the steel
    %p
      Rock a bye baby
      Listen to your heartbeat pumping to a fine ravine
      Of all things it's a vain of a shrine
      All missions impossible are possible, cause I'm
      Heading for a new sector 365 days from now, I'll
      Wipe the sweat from my eye
      And each and every true will stick, or fall from the sky of my cloud nine
      From homies all the way to chicks, no matter how fine
      Controlling is a swollen way to wreck a proud mind
      You hold it in your hands and watch a man start crying
      Tear after tear in the puppet man's hands
      Every time you take a stance you do the puppet man's dance
      And the worlds at a stand-still
      Deep in broken mansville, trapped in the moat with an anvil, still
      Killing yourself, and dogging ya health
      You ain't amphibious, so grab a hold of yourself
    %p
      Shit is-shit is ill, my flow still will spill
      Toxic slick to shock you sick like electrocute
      When I execute, acutely over the rhythm
      On those that pollute, extra dosages is what I gotta give em
      Got em mad and tremblin
      Cause I been up in my lab assemblin
      Missiles, to bomb the enemy
      Because they envy me, and the making of my mad currency
      Currently I think we're in a state of an emergency
      Cause niggas done sold their souls, and now their souls is hollow
      And I think they can't follow
      They can't swallow, the truth because it hurts
      This is how I put it down, this is my earth, my turf
      The worth of my birth is a billion, and you know what time it is
      I'm going to make a million
      (You know what time is it? Never)
