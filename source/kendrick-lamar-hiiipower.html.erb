      <p class="verse verse-one">
        <span>Visions</span> of Martin Luther staring at me,
        Malcolm X put a hex on my future, someone catch me.
        I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song, the Serengeti's clone,
        Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone.
        You slipped your disc when I slid you my disc,
        You wanted to diss but jumped on my dick.
        Grown men never should bite their tongue,
        Unless you eating pussy that smell like it's a stale plum,
        I got my finger on the mothafuckin' Pistol.
      </p>
      <p class="verse verse-two">
        <span>Aiming</span> it at a pig, Charlotte's web is going to miss you,
        My issue isn't televised, and you ain't gotta tell the wise.
        How to stay on beat, because our life's an instrumental,
        This is physical and mental, I won't sugar coat it,
        You'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it.
        And everything on TV just a figment of imagination,
        I don't want plastic nation, dread that like a Haitian,
        While you mothafuckas waiting, I be off the slave ship,
        Building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs.
      </p>
      <p class="verse verse-three">
        <span>Visions</span> of Martin Luther staring at me,
        If I see it how he seen it, that would make my parents happy.
        Sorry mama, I can't turn the other cheek,
        They wanna knock me off the edge like a fucking widow's peak, uhh.
        And she always told me pray for the weak, uhh,
        Them demons got me, I ain't prayed in some weeks, uhh,
        Dear Lord come save me, the devil's working hard.
        He probly clocking double shifts on all of his jobs,
        Frightening, so fucking frightening.
      </p>
      <p class="verse verse-four">
        <span>Enough</span> to drive a man insane, I need a license to kill,
        I'm standing on the field full of land mines,
        Doing the moonwalk, hoping I blow up in time.
        Cause 2012 might not be a fucking legend, 
        Tryna be a fucking legend, the man of mankind,
        Who said a black man in the Illuminati?
        Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party, 
        So get up off that slave ship, 
        Build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs.
      </p>
      <p class="verse verse-five">
        <span>Who</span> said a black man in the Illuminati?
        Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party.
        Last time I checked, we was racing with Marcus Garvey,
        On the freeway to Africa 'til I wreck my Audi,
        And I want everybody to view my autopsy,
        So you can see exactly where the government had shot me.
        No conspiracy, my fate is inevitable,
        They play musical chairs once I'm on that pedestal,
        Frightening, so fucking frightening,
        Enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane,
        The reason Lauryn Hill don't sing, or Kurt Cobain.
      </p>
      <p class="verse verse-six">
        <span>Loaded</span> that clip and then said bang, the drama it bring is crazy,
        Product of the late 80's.
        Tryna stay above water, that's why we shun the navy,
        Pull your guns and play me, let's set it off.
        Cause a riot, throw a Molotov, somebody told me them pirates had got lost,
        Cause we been off them slave ships,
        Got our own pyramids, write our own hieroglyphs.
      </p>
