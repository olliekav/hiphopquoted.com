        I seen some cold nights and bloody days <br/>
        They grab and me bullets spray <br/>
        They use me wrong so I sing this song 'til this day <br/>
        My body is cold steel for real <br/>
        I was made to kill, that's why they keep me concealed <br/>
        Under car seats they sneak me in clubs <br/>
        Been in the hands of mad thugs <br/>
        They feed me when they load me with mad slugs <br/>
        Seventeen precisely, one in my head <br/>
        They call me Desert Eagle, semi-auto with lead <br/>
        I'm seven inches four pounds, been through so many towns <br/>
        Ohio to Little Rock to Canarsie, livin harshly <br/>
        Beat up and battered, they pull me out <br/>
        I watch as niggaz scattered, makin me kill <br/>
        But what I feel it never mattered <br/>
        When I'm empty I'm quiet, findin myself fiendin to be fired <br/>
        A broken safety, niggaz place me in shelves <br/>
        under beds, so I beg for my next owner to be a thoroughbred <br/>
        Keep me full up with hollow heads <br/>

      %p.chorus  
        How you like me now? I go blaow <br/>
        It's that shit that moves crowds makin every ghetto foul <br/>
        I might have took your first child <br/>
        Scarred your life, crippled your style <br/>
        I gave you power <br/>
        I made you buck wild <br/>

      %p 
        Always I'm in some shit, my abdomen is the clip <br/>
        The barrel is my dick, uncircumcised <br/>
        Pull my skin back and cock me, I bust off when they unlock me <br/>
        Results of what happens to niggaz shock me <br/>
        I see niggaz bleedin runnin from me in fear, stunningly tears <br/>
        fall down the eyes of these so-called tough guys, for years <br/>
        I've been used in robberies, givin niggaz heart to follow me <br/>
        Placin peoples in graves, funerals made cause I was sprayed <br/>
        I was laid in a shelf, with a grenade <br/>
        Met a wrecked-up tech with numbers on his chest that say <br/>
        Five-two-oh-nine-three-eight-five and zero <br/>
        Had a serial defaced, hopin one day, police would place <br/>
        where he came from, a name or some sort of person to claim him <br/>
        Tired of murderin, made him wanna be a plain gun <br/>
        But yo I had some other plans, like the next time the beef is on <br/>
        I make myself jam right in my owner's hand <br/>

      %p.chorus  
        How you like me now? I go blaow <br/>
        It's that shit that moves crowds makin every ghetto foul <br/>
        I might have took your first child <br/>
        Scarred your life, crippled your style <br/>
        I gave you power <br/>
        I made you buck wild <br/>

        Yo, weeks went by and I'm surprised <br/>
        Still stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides <br/>
        Besides me it's bullets, two vests and then a nine <br/>
        There's a grenade in a box, and that tech that kept cryin <br/>
        Cause he ain't been cleaned in a year, he's rusty as clear <br/>
        He's bout to fall to pieces, cause of his murder career <br/>
        Yo, I can hear somebody comin in, open the shelf <br/>
        His eyes bubblin, he said, "It was on" <br/>
        I felt his palm troubled him shakin <br/>
        Somebody stomped him out, his dome was achin <br/>
        He placed me on his waist, the moment I've been waitin <br/>
        My creation was for blacks to kill blacks <br/>
        It's gats like me that accidentally, go off, makin niggaz memories <br/>
        But this time, it's done intentionally <br/>
        He walked me outside, saw this cat <br/>
        Cocked me back, said, "Remember me?" <br/>
        He pulled the trigger but I held on, it felt wrong <br/>
        Knowing niggaz is waiting in hell for 'im <br/>
        He squeezed harder, I didn't budge, sick of the blood <br/>
        Sick of the thugs, sick of wrath of the, next man's grudge <br/>
        What the other kid did was pull out, no doubt <br/>
        A newer me in better shape, before he lit out, he lead the chase <br/>
        My owner fell to the floor, his wig split so fast <br/>
        I didn't know he was hit, it's over with <br/>
        Heard mad niggaz screamin, niggaz runnin, cops is comin <br/>
        Now I'm happy, until I felt somebody else grab me <br/>
        Damn!
