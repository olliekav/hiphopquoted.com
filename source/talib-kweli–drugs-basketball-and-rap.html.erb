      Niggas gettin caught in the trap
      For the cash, it's the drugs; basketball; or the rap
      There's more to us than that
      We the shit consider the facts, after you analyze that
      You know you best to fall back
    %p
      I'm dealing with, nothing but facts, when I spit it, though
      You niggas superstitious don't step on the cracks or split the poem
      Candle light, flickers so bright, I feel the wick can kick a sicker flow
      And spill it like a liquor store, I spit the shit to make a cripple get up and dance
      I spit the shit to make the average MC piss in his pants
      I spit the shit to make a motherfucker call it a night
      I spit the shit to see fuck wit C. Delores Tucker sex like
      I take a sip from my creative well, in this game for a minute
      I play this well to win it, you go to Africa, like Dave Chappelle, you finished
      Cause your prehistoric raps is boring, the number of whack rappers soaring
      Like the percentages of teenagers who have abortions
      These niggas meek, their lyrics weak, and their beats is corporate
      They try snitching on records their mouths is leaking faucets
      Dripping them over system than, Chinese water torture
      Ripping a series of events, more unfortunate than Lemony Snicket
    %p
      Medallions mind, bless the mic for the gods, teach the blind
      Plus get a piece of mine release your minds for each design
      Baby food for thought, rappers not ?? for sport
      You ?? pork eatin niggas of sort
      Yo you's a fuckface, burnt out loser that's always up late
      Planet ? the revolutionary slash nut case
      A witchcraft black magic, data load up computers
      A spread the message wrote to you where when I show illusions
      If all y'all niggas is killas then how you write your records
      How'd you find the time stop lying, your minds' infected
      There's only a few, and I ain't saying niggas don't put it down from you town
      I'm talkin bout you
      Yea the fake dude promotin propaganda
      And open on some fanna, and out right, snitching on them cameras
      Planet ?, gold chain black bandanas low
      Steady gain click clack rang rang, there they go
    %p
      Just a high skip and a jump
      Away from getting everything that I could possibly want
      And prostitutes front
      Get a 4 bar on the roster, scratch that
      I'm talkin about a full roster of raps
      Monsters that rap, buzzed out ?? check the cadence of the frequency
      Uniquely, we strong arms strategically
      Easily I twist the ?? killa cali ??
      Back alleys burnin backwoods in danelis or
      He probably with Kweli, out in BK
      We make it easy for the DJ's, like instant replays
      Conversation by the buttons, I talk and touch something
      Straight shots of the Louis he flew me out to London
      Crunchin numbers flippin more dough, like siccisero
      Next thing you know we kissin ya ho, without the mistletoe
      Strong arm steady, agony can ???, fill the rigglies
      The Big League niggas is dropping indies
      Let's go
