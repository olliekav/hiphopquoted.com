      <p class="numbers">
        Yo, check it <span>one</span> for Charlie Hustle, <span>2</span> for Steady Rock
        <span>3</span> for the forthcoming live future shock.
        It's <span>5</span> dimensions, <span>6</span> senses,
        <span>7</span> firmaments of heaven and hell, <span>8</span> Million Stories to tell.
        <span>9</span> planets faithfully keep in orbit,
        With the probable <span>tenth</span>, the universe expands length.
      </p>
      <p class="block">    
        The body of my text possess extra strength.
        Power-lift the powerless up out of this towering inferno,
        My ink so hot it burn through the journal.
        I'm blacker than midnight on Broadway and Myrtle,
        Hip-Hop passed all your tall social hurdles.
        Like the nationwide project-prison-industry complex,
        Working-class poor: better keep your alarm set.
        Streets too loud to ever hear freedom ring,
        Say evacuate your sleep, it's dangerous to dream.
        But you chain cats j-j-pow! You dead now,
        Killing fields need blood to graze the cash cow,
        It's a number game, but shit don't add up somehow.
      </p>
      <p class="numbers">
        Like I got, <span>16</span> to <span>32</span> bars to rock it,
        But only <span>15%</span> of profits ever see my pockets like.
        69 billion in the last <span>20</span> years,
        Spent on national defense but folks still live in fear like.
        Nearly half of America's largest cities is one-quarter black,
        That's why they gave Ricky Ross all the crack.
        <span>16</span> ounces to a pound, <span>20</span> more to a ki,
        A <span>5</span>-minute sentence hearing and you're no longer free.
        <span>40%</span> of Americans own a cell phone,
        So they can hear everything that you say when you ain't home.
      </p>
      <p class="block">
        I guess Michael Jackson was right: "You Are Not Alone",
        Rock your hardhat, black, cause you in the Terrordome.
        Full of hard niggas, large niggas, dice-tumblers,
        Young teens and prison greens facing life numbers.
        Crack mothers, crack babies and AIDS patients,
        Young bloods can't spell but they could rock you in PlayStation.
        This new math is whipping motherfuckers' ass,
        You want to know how to rhyme you better learn how to add.
        It's mathematics
      </p>
      <p class="numbers">
        It's <span>one</span> universal law but <span>2</span> sides to every story,
        <span>3</span> strikes and you be in for life, mandatory.
        <span>4</span> MC's murdered in the last <span>4</span> years,
        I ain't trying to be the <span>fifth</span> one, the millennium is here.
        Yo it's <span>6</span> Million Ways to Die, from the <span>7</span> deadly thrills,
        <span>8</span>-year olds getting found with <span>9</span>mils.
        It's <span>10</span> P.M., where your seeds at? What's the deal?
      </p>
      <p class="block">
        He on the hill pumping krill to keep they belly filled,
        Light in the ass with heavy steel, sights on the pretty shit in life.
        Young soldiers trying to earn their next stripe,
        When the average minimum wage is $5.15.
        You best believe you've got to find a new grind to get C.R.E.A.M,
        The white unemployment rate? It's nearly more than triple for black.
        Some front-liners got their gun in your back,
        Bubbling crack, jewel theft and robbery to combat poverty.
        And end up in the global jail economy,
        Stiffer stipulations attached to each sentence.
        Budget cutbacks but increased police presence,
        And even if you get out of prison still living.
        Join the other <span>5</span> million under state supervision,
        This is business: no faces, just lines and statistics.
        From your phone, your zip code to S-S-I digits,
        The system break man, child, and women into figures.
        2 columns for "who is" and "who ain't niggas",
        Numbers is hard and real and they never have feelings.
        But you push too hard, even numbers got limits,
        Why did one straw break the camel's back? Here's the secret:.
        The million other straws underneath it: it's all mathematics.
