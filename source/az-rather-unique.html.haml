      We was already molded into people's minds as mulignanes
      Now we more fucked up with a mayor named Giuliani
      You can try to blind me, analyze but can't define me
      My mind's divine, heavily entwined with Gandhi's
      Far from feeble, I leave your nostrils hard to breathe through
      Cause my cerebrals are more of a higher plane than the Hebrews
      My mic devotion brings out my deepest emotions
      Overdosing wannabes posing, sending them through convulsions
      Too hard to follow, you took a bite but couldn't swallow
      Your mind's boggled, but I'm as deep as Donald Goines novels
      My whole persona's kinda laid back like a recliner
      And since a minor, I been fucking with marijuana
      Wavy-haired, my skin got a money getting glare
      Strictly menace wear, macking offa Guinness beer
      So where it all begins is here, destiny and me finally meet
      So how can I be weak? I'm rather unique
    %p
      My verbals rip shit, brains give birth to thoughts in triplets
      Fuck it I'm on some flip shit, ready to let my clip spit
      Dramatical, vocals release shells like automatics do
      Music's magical causing any battles to be tragical
      Child, got a style sick as hell, sicker than sickle cell anemia
      Slaughter your circulatory like lukemia
      Filled with larceny, who want parts of me? I'm vicious
      Mad malicious, cause it's real on this road to riches
      I got this mastered, other rappers'll craft it
      Weak and wicked camouflaged as killers how they speak and kick it
      Peep this uniqueness, non-believers I'm leaving speechless
      Left to choke as if skunk smoke was coming through the speakers
      Surgically nice with any verbal device, trife
      Breathing life into mics, my insight's beyond the twilight
      So die or fight, no surrender, no retreat
      Techniques speak, I'm rather unique
    %p
      So it's gonna take more than your astrologist to knowledge this
      A physiologist couldn't even figure out the exoticness
      Raps demolishing certified the way I style it
      My wordplay blaze with the rays of ultraviolet
      My culture's smiling, getting more in depth with each breath
      Autobiography follows the footsteps of Malcolm X
      Money and sex, Gore-Tex, Donna Karan and Guess
      Finesse, success through the life stress, mics I bless
      Puffing trees to get me high as trapeze, looking Japanese
      At ease when I'm stacking G's, so let's discuss, plus degrees
      How the rhyme forces the source for thoughts that's lost
      So don't cross cause it'll cost
      The ghetto savior, smooth, the real playa with flavor
      Moves be major, with un-explainable behavior
      The word's on the street so keep your ears to the concrete
