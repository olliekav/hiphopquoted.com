      One two three, in the place to be!
      MF Doom, Talib Kweli, ah here we go
      On born days, I used to blow out the candles; and every Saturday
      Watch cartoons 'til noon and then I'd switch to Ralph McDaniels
      I was, makin up a miracle flow, over a cereal bowl
      And a porous beat from my stereo
      Rhymes stronger than Popeye with the spinach
      Yeah I'm gangster like the frog on Courageous Cat and Minute Mouse
      Maybe I'm trippin and it's just a cartoon to you
      But I got chills when I heard how Doom flipped the Scooby Doo
      And, I might be buggin but it seem to me
      That cartoons be realer than reality TV
      They inspire my decision to be open and listen
      But folks got it all twisted, like a yoga position
      Like, in order to spit it dope, you gotta have a criminal past
      That's similar to the cast of Different Strokes
      Me and my people break bread, sit and smoke
      The conversation rich, but that depend on what you consider broke
      I draw on anything for inspiration
      A fond memory, a piece of paper, walls in a train station
    %p
      It's just that I'm old school like that, roll that rap over soul loops like that
      It's just that I'm old school like that, roll that rap over soul loops like that
      (I'm old school y'all, yes y'all, I keep it goin y'all, here we go)
      It's just that I'm old school like that, roll that rap over soul loops like that
      (I'm old school y'all, keep it goin y'all, keep it goin y'all)
      It's just that I'm old school like that, roll that rap over soul loops like that
      (Ah here we go, c'mon)
    %p
      And we'll be right back after these messages
      Fellas grab your nutsacs, chicks squeeze your breastesses
      We ain't all that grown, it's still funny like
      Goin to the store on your own with rainbow money
      Since then had an insane flow sonny
      Walkin to the corner rhymin in the rain, nose runny
      Breakdancin maybe ten, bummy
      Is when Subroc would run up handspring Arabian somee!
      Ooh wee, like a Hong Kong Phooey kick
      Or a weekend afternoon, karate movie flick
      Slept good, no justice, no peace
      Woody kept it hoody, never discussed it with police
      Shot the fair one nobody ran to get the gat
      Or felt they had to put it up in they raps to set it fat
      And since when lyrical skills had to do with killin a cat?
      What type of chitlins is that?
      The Super Villain has the bad hydroponics
      Whoever willin to ride, provide raw chronic
