      <p>
        One two three, in the place to be!
        MF Doom, Talib Kweli, ah here we go,
        On born days, I used to blow out the candles; and every Saturday,
        Watch cartoons 'til noon and then I'd switch to Ralph McDaniels,
        I was, makin up a miracle flow, over a cereal bowl,
        And a porous beat from my stereo,
        Rhymes stronger than Popeye with the spinach,
        Yeah I'm gangster like the frog on Courageous Cat and Minute Mouse,
        Maybe I'm trippin and it's just a cartoon to you,
        But I got chills when I heard how Doom flipped the Scooby Doo,
        And, I might be buggin but it seem to me,
        That cartoons be realer than reality TV,
        They inspire my decision to be open and listen,
        But folks got it all twisted, like a yoga position,
        Like, in order to spit it dope, you gotta have a criminal past,
        That's similar to the cast of Different Strokes,
        Me and my people break bread, sit and smoke,
        The conversation rich, but that depend on what you consider broke,
        I draw on anything for inspiration,
        A fond memory, a piece of paper, walls in a train station.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's just that I'm old school like that, roll that rap over soul loops like that
      </p>
      <p>
        And we'll be right back after these messages,
        Fellas grab your nutsacs, chicks squeeze your breastesses,
        We ain't all that grown, it's still funny like,
        Goin to the store on your own with rainbow money,
        Since then had an insane flow sonny,
        Walkin to the corner rhymin in the rain, nose runny,
        Breakdancin maybe ten, bummy,
        Is when Subroc would run up handspring Arabian somee!
        Ooh wee, like a Hong Kong Phooey kick,
        Or a weekend afternoon, karate movie flick,
        Slept good, no justice, no peace,
        Woody kept it hoody, never discussed it with police,
        Shot the fair one nobody ran to get the gat,
        Or felt they had to put it up in they raps to set it fat,
        And since when lyrical skills had to do with killin a cat?
        What type of chitlins is that?
        The Super Villain has the bad hydroponics,
        Whoever willin to ride, provide raw chronic.
