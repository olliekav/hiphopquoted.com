      <p>
        Where are the weapons of mass destruction?
        We been lookin' for months and we ain't found nothin'
        Please Mr. President, tell us something
        We knew from the beginning that your ass was bluffing!
      </p>
      <p>
        How unfortunate, it wasn't what you thought it kid, in basic training
        They taught you how to slay man as a start-up kit
        and you showed up with a gun to load up
        Hopin' a college education's waitin', maybe a steady occupation
        Now you're weighing many lives against yours
        President orders, got you on course, with holocaust, Sargent is lost
        General's boss, plans cross, now you in the crosshair
        of a sniper's shaky scared, shot of your ear
        All fucked up now! one round just hit him in his from some young yet expendable citizen
        He's from the other side of the line, fightin' for time
        Time to see his kids walk, time to talk with his pops
        Time to have a rational thought without the thought of bein' shot
        (Damn) his gun jammed now you gotta bombart
        It's a soldier's suicide slide - know you tried hard to stay alive
        When you're catching fire from both sides
        and we miss you at home, its time the government truly left you alone
        Dropped you off and popped one in your dome
        Now we've seen it in Iraq and the Congo - America's motto
        "Kill their leader then we build a stronghold!!"
      </p>
      <p>
        I never thought of this the day that I enlisted
        That I'd be dodging bullets, seekin weapons that never even existed
        For someone else's personal beef, I risk myself
        While the Commander-in-Chief, would never come to fight himself
        I feel I'm bein' tricked even worse that the civilians
        Nobody ever told me that we would be killin' children!!
        Feelin like the ones that sent me here are the psychotics
        but if I say that out loud -- I'm "unpatriotic"
        but would Donald Rumsfeld back me up with the chrome?
        Would Tom Ridge fight or would he stay secure back home?
        and would Condoleeza Rice cover grenades in a fox hole?
        I'm startin to believe what I was told is not so
        What's the reason for the war?
        I'm shootin at these people that I got not animosity for
        I wonder if I'm just a pawn in someone else's struggle
        or a here even though I'm just a small piece of the puzzle
        I know that when I finally return where I reside
        I'll make up for the months my wife and moms cried
        and carry on for all my fallen brothers that died
        but you can't take my pride -- cuz I'm a fuckin' SOLDIER
      </p>
