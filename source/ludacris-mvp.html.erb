      I'm the MVP, I'm stupid with this rap shit

      When Premier puts the needle on the record then I put it on blaast, 
      your flow is garbage, I throw it in the trash, 
      I'm the MVP, I'm stupid with this rap shit, 
      rewind the verse, make the track do a back flip, 
      your speakers poppin' on a handstand, 
      they snaek dissin' niggas, throwin' little jabs like Bam-Bam, 
      and I'm a bad man, 
      they amatures like at Apollo, I wipe 'em off the stage like Sandman, 
      damn man, what the hell you smokin' on, 
      it's Ludacris I got more cheese than Prombolon, 
      and the chrome is home, so I'm never home alone, 
      and only keep friends with 2-X chromosomes, 
      so I command all these rappers: "Put the mic down!", 
      throw a grenade in your mouth "Nigga, bite down!!", 
      'cause I'm back with Premo on the track, 
      takin' it to the essence, showin' niggas how to rap 
    %p
      Still hungry as the day I began 
      I heat the booth up so much the engineer caught a muthafuckin' tan, 
      I'm the truth, when it comes to it, 
      I hold Hip Hop for hostage, since 2000 I put a gun to it, 
      and I run through it, like a jamaican boat, 
      and everyday is a vacation on jamaican smoke, 
      charge your whole block, 
      talk shit, they hear the four pop, 
      "One, Two!" and it don't stop, 
      and my deliveries invaded your vicinity, Hennesy is my remedy, takin' shots like Kennedy, 
      and I've been a G, for a long time, 
      to these streets I'm connected like I'm online, 
      on time for whatever, 
      and everytime and album drop, I drop big like Voletta, 
      I'm ahead of the competition, they wishin' I just fade off, 
      my career for your life, let's trade off 
    %p
      8 years in the game, ain't a damn thang change, 
      so I brought it back to one of the tracks, so where the damn thang came, 
      and he goin' down in history, 'cause he don't sleep, 
      and he the first southern rapper on a Premo beat, 
      I ate the kick and the snare, 
      the samples always taste fine, 
      and I shoot a hot sixteen from the baseline, 
      I'm on point like CP3, 
      and I'll be goin' down in rap as the MVP
