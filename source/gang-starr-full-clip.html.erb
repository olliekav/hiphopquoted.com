      <p>
        Fresh out the gate again, time to raise the stakes again.
        Fatten my plate again, y'all cats know we always play to win.
        G-A-N-G to the Starr son.
        Haters took this shit too far son.
        So that's all for you, I'm wiping out your whole team.
        I'll splatter your dreams with lyrics to shatter your schemes.
        The badder you seem, the more lies you tell.
        The more lies you sell, and by surprise you fell.
        Into my deathtrap, right into my clutches.
        Stupid, you know the God must bless every single mic he touches.
        I've suffered, just so I could return harder.
        Wanna be the shit starter, fuck around, make you a martyr.
        I make ya famous, turn around and make ya nameless.
        Cause you never understood how vital to me this rap game is.
        Save it and hold that, you catch a hot one.
        Rhymes chase a fake nigga down soon as I spot one.
      </p>
      <p>
        So if you stand in my way, I'm gonna have to spray.
        Learn that if you come against me son you're gonna have to pray.
        Since back in the day I held the weight and kept my head up.
        They wanna see the God catch an L it's all a set up.
        I give no man or thing power over me.
        Why these niggas so jealous and looking sour, over me?
        I'm bolder G, I'm like impossible to stop.
        I'm like that nigga in the ring with you, impossible to drop.
        I'm like two magazines fully loaded to your one.
        Plus I ain't gonna quit spitting til you're done.
        Plus, more than ever I got my whole shit together.
        More than a decade of hits that'll live forever.
        Catching rep off my name, you're bound to fry.
        Know how many niggas that I know is down to die.
        We never fail, and we ain't never been frail.
        You niggas talk crime, but you scared of jail.
      </p>
      <p>
        Attacking like a slick Apache, lyrics are trigger happy.
        Blowing back your wig piece just for the way you're looking at me.
        Cock back, blaow, I hit you up right now.
        I don't know why so many of y'all wanna be thugs anyhow.
        Face the consequence of your childish nonsense.
        I could make your head explode just by my lyrical content.
        Get you in my scope and metaphorically snipe ya.
        I never liked ya, I gas that ass and then ignite ya.
        The flame thrower, make your peeps afraid to know ya.
        How many times I told ya, play your position small soldier.
        My heart is colder, makes me wanna resort to violence.
        Stop beating me in the head son, nah, I'm not buying it.
        I'm ready to blast, ready to surpass and harass.
        I'm ready to flip, yeah I'm ready to dip with all the cash.
        I hold my chrome steady, with a tight grip.
        So watch your dome already cause this one might hit.
