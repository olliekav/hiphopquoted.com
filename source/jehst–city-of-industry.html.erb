      Airborne
      My thoughts shrouded by cloud-form
      The land ravaged in the wake of this ground war
      The quintessential outlaw
      Eye of the storm
      My tears fall as the torrential downpour
      The flood
      Your death wish written in blood
      I came in from the cold
      Clothes drippin’ with mud
      Grippin’ a club
      Primitive as Stig Of The Dump
      Swingin’ a punch
      The bad seed
      Pick of the bunch
      I drink black rain
      Take another swig and I’m drunk,
      Taste venom on the tip of my tongue
      My lip’s cold
      Spittin’ out toxins I couldn’t dissolve
      Or withhold
      I never sold my soul for fool’s gold
      So I’m still free
      But too numb to feel pity
      Some broke down
      Now the steel city’s a ghost town
      Snowflakes cover the ground in white carpets
      Seasons of espionage as time passes
      The lion-hearted
      Survival of the hardest artist
      My open arms embrace darkness
      Still cravin’ carnage and infamy
      But even parasites starve in this carcass of industry
    %p
      You can see me as cynical
      Trapped in my own gothic vision
      Encapsulating chaos in this composition
      Calculated
      Like the lies of a politician
      Grippin’ a slingshot
      I size up the opposition
      I drop a match in the clouds and watch the flames rise
      Fire-water fallin’ from these grey skies
      To painted trainlines
      Chrome over redbrick
      Reflective
      Like a gemstone in a cesspit
      Jehst gives belief to a skeptic
      The truth neglected
      Like open wounds that turn septic
      Infected
      By the forked tongue of a liar
      Now my thoughts are the colour of fire
      And my nights spent bunnin’ the kya
      Uninspired by the freak-show
      I see ghosts
      dance in the trail of my weed smoke
      My words are folklore
      That survived the cold war
      New world order and so forth
      I go north
      Ankle deep in snowfall
      Leapin’ over dry stone walls with a holdall
      Steam clouds rise from my fiery breath
      It’s the last twilight before the silence of death
