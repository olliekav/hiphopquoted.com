      <p>
        I used to guzzle 40's, and own a beat up Caddy<br>
        Since the hood still love me, I'll turn the heat up daddy<br>
        I went from mackin fly honies on the train<br>
        To straight relaxin on the beach, countin money gettin brain<br>
        Soon as you rappers get a chance you wanna floss a lot<br>
        You buy a iced out watch because it cost a lot<br>
        Then you in the club, stylin with dough<br>
        Profilin with hoes that we boned, a while ago<br>
        You rookies haven't done enough laps around the track<br>
        You had one hot single, but then your album sounds wack<br>
        Son you bore me with your war stories<br>
        You ain't even do that shit, so that's just more stories<br>
        How you expect us to take you seriously?<br>
        The look in my eye punk, has got you scared of me<br>
        I'm blastin your sons, I'm snatchin your funds<br>
        You catch a royal ass-whoopin, you've been askin for one
      </p>
      <p>
        Bitch you don't even know, the half about me<br>
        I bring it straight to your chest, ask your staff about me<br>
        I'm just a little bit older, plus a whole lot wiser<br>
        I might advise ya, or I might pulverize ya<br>
        I can visit any city, get respect in the street<br>
        While you alone in your room, shook to death of the streets<br>
        I'll take a second to speak, I keep my weapon in reach<br>
        I ain't talkin romance but you'll get swept off your feet<br>
        I keeps a ghetto chick, that loves to blast and she peddle shit<br>
        Groupies fake moves, I get her to settle shit<br>
        You can't compare to the status right here<br>
        Legendary worldwide, we can battle right here<br>
        Listen junior, I'mma tear back your wig<br>
        This ain't TV but I'll show you what a "Fear Factor" is<br>
        Stop grillin me, and all that frontin is killin me<br>
        You leave me no choice but to hurt your feelings G
      </p>
