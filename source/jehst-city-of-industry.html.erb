      <p>
        Airborne
        My thoughts shrouded by cloud-form
        The land ravaged in the wake of this ground war
        The quintessential outlaw
        Eye of the storm
        My tears fall as the torrential downpour
        The flood
        Your death wish written in blood
        I came in from the cold
        Clothes drippin’ with mud
        Grippin’ a club
        Primitive as Stig Of The Dump
        Swingin’ a punch
        The bad seed
        Pick of the bunch
        I drink black rain
        Take another swig and I’m drunk,
        Taste venom on the tip of my tongue
        My lip’s cold
        Spittin’ out toxins I couldn’t dissolve
        Or withhold
        I never sold my soul for fool’s gold
        So I’m still free
        But too numb to feel pity
        Some broke down
        Now the steel city’s a ghost town
        Snowflakes cover the ground in white carpets
        Seasons of espionage as time passes
        The lion-hearted
        Survival of the hardest artist
        My open arms embrace darkness
        Still cravin’ carnage and infamy
        But even parasites starve in this carcass of industry
      </p>
      <p>
        You can see me as cynical
        Trapped in my own gothic vision
        Encapsulating chaos in this composition
        Calculated
        Like the lies of a politician
        Grippin’ a slingshot
        I size up the opposition
        I drop a match in the clouds and watch the flames rise
        Fire-water fallin’ from these grey skies
        To painted trainlines
        Chrome over redbrick
        Reflective
        Like a gemstone in a cesspit
        Jehst gives belief to a skeptic
        The truth neglected
        Like open wounds that turn septic
        Infected
        By the forked tongue of a liar
        Now my thoughts are the colour of fire
        And my nights spent bunnin’ the kya
        Uninspired by the freak-show
        I see ghosts
        dance in the trail of my weed smoke
        My words are folklore
        That survived the cold war
        New world order and so forth
        I go north
        Ankle deep in snowfall
        Leapin’ over dry stone walls with a holdall
        Steam clouds rise from my fiery breath
        It’s the last twilight before the silence of death
      </p>
