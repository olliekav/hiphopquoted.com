      <p>
        <span>This shit is wicked on these mean streets</span>
        None of my friends speak, we're all tryna win but then again.
        Maybe it's for the best though cause when they're saying too much.
        You know they're trying to get you touched.
        Whoever said illegal was the easy way out, couldn't understand.
        The mechanics and the workings of the underworld, granted.
        Nine to five is how to survive, I ain't trying to survive.
        I'm tryna live it to the limit and love it a lot.
        Life ills poisoned my body.
        I used to say fuck mic skills, I never prayed to God, I prayed to Gotti.
        That's right it's wicked, that's life I live it.
        Ain't asking for forgiveness for my sins, ends.
        I break bread with the late heads.
        Picking their brains for angles on, all the evils that the game'll do.
        It gets dangerous, money and power is changing us.
        And now we're lethal, infected with D'evils.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>We used to fight for building blocks</span>
        Now we fight for blocks with buildings that make a killing.
        The closest of friends when we first started.
        But grew apart as the money grew and soon grew black-hearted.
        Thinking back when we first learned to use rubbers.
        He never learned so in turn I'm kidnapping his baby's mother.
        My hand around her collar, feeding her cheese.
        She said the taste of dollars was shitty so I fed her fifties.
        About his whereabouts I wasn't convinced.
        I kept feeding her money 'til her shit started to make sense.
        Who could ever foresee, we used to stay up all night.
        At slumber parties, now I'm tryna rock this bitch to sleep.
        All the years we were real close, now I see his fears.
        Through her tears know she's wishing we were still close.
        Don't cry, it is to be, in time.
        I'll take away your miseries and make it mine, D'evils.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>My flesh, no nigga could test</span>
        My soul is possessed by D'evils in the form of diamonds and Lexuses.
        The Exorcist, got me doing sticks like "homie.
        You don't know me but the whole world owe me, strip!".
        Was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fucking life.
        So now I'm down for whatever ain't nothing nice.
        Throughout my junior high years it was all friendly.
        But now this higher learning got the Remy in me.
        Liquor's invaded my kidneys.
        Got me ready to lick off, mama forgive me.
        I can't be held accountable, D'evils beating me down, boo.
        Got me running with guys making G's, telling lies that sound true.
        Come test me, I never cower.
        For the love of money, son, I'm giving lead showers.
        Stop screaming, you know the demon said it's best to die.
        And even if Jehovah witness, bet he'll never testify, D'evils.
