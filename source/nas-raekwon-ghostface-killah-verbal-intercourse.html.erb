        Through the lights cameras and action, glamour glitters <br/>and gold.
      I unfold the scroll, plant seeds to stampede the globe.
      When I'm deceased, by then the beast arise like yeast
      to conquer peace leaving savages to roam in the streets.
      Live on the run, police paying me to give in my gun
      Trick my Wisdom, with the system that imprisoned my son. <br/><br/>
      Smoke a gold leaf I hold heat, nonchalantly
      I'm grungy, but things I do is real it never haunts me
      while, funny style niggaz roll in the pile
      rooster heads profile on a bus to Riker's Isle.
      Holdin weed inside they pussy with they minds on the
      pretty things in life, props is a true thug's wife. <br/><br/>
      It's like a cycle, niggaz come home, some'll go in
      Do a bullet, come back, do the same shit again.
      From the womb to the tomb, presume the unpredictable
      Guns salute life, rapidly, that's the ritual.

        Perhaps bullets bust niggaz discuss mad money true lies and white guys.
      We can see it through the eyes.
      Catch the most on tape, kilos disintegrate.
      Pyrex pots, we break, fiends lickin plates.
      In the building niggaz building, like little children starin.
      Them older niggaz aint carin.<br/><br/>
      Sirens circlin fiends are lurkin in your baggage.
      oh, one's gone now, what, smack him in his cabbage.
      In the woodwork, crack cells bubble like Woolworth's.
      in the projects, richest niggaz rockin all the real worth<br/><br/>
      Police questioning, rooftop cats invested in
      Tradin in they Lexus' GS's sendin messages.
      Two and two makes four, Cristal's crazily pour.
      Gun wars my crew phantom like swords.

    %p#quote_three.column

      %span 
        With the green leathers, hunded pound snakes <br/>and cakes.
      Fiends found in lakes, jeolously jakes we shake,
      What I strive for is what I live for,
      Infatuated by material things, and it's wild like for war
      like somewhere over the rainbow, I see a big pot of gold
      Future stacks yo I hold.<br/><br/>
      Thousands of cracks bagged up inside the shoebox,
      Don't keep jack in my lap, don't wanna see Tupac.
      Got two spots, a new lot, flooded with rocks
      Shoot-outs making me hot, crooked cops Bad Tony and the ball drop.
      In the Now, I'm bangin niggaz for slide time
      Hurry up Duke I'm next, show em mine
      And what the f**k is you looking at?<br/><br/>
      By the way young blood, hit me off with that Green Bay hat
      Watch your back inside the hall, new niggaz slide through
      like doors yo, you're starin in the mess hall
      Your adrenaline runs, cigarette niggas be swindlin
      New jacks surrenderin, come home not rememberin. <br/><br/>
      Made bail with different size kicks on, a white dress shirt
      Lookin gay in the yard, and you got hurt
      Flashbacks, of the day room, mop ringer style
      Your faggot a*s got bashed tryin to turn the dial.
      You told your boo you was whylin
      Once you heard Wu, out of the blue, your family's from Shaolin.<br/><br/>
      High cla*s cooks, throw on vestes out of phone books
      Infirmary niggas are screaming, &quot;I got drugs!&quot;
      Sharpen toothbrushes 190 mixed with baby oil and shit
      Your man's in the kitchen stashing ice picks
      Well I'ma end this with a big red cherry on top
      Me, Nas and Rae got the best product on the block.

      Strength my whole team is eatin off this type of shit
      Word up, throw your hands up
      Good shit, nigga next time, no more whatever shit
      Cock back the Mac an say whatever
      Keep your eyes open and your wallet in your front pocket
      Your Hawaiian's stale, exoticness, fly shit
      RZA Chef Ghost and Nas niggaz is the prophet
      Floatin on in nine-five in the basement
