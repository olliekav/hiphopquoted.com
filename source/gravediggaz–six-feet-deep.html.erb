      I floss my teeth on a gospel track
      I'm not an apostle, but I bring the axe to ya back
      I chew and attack
      Like Crest on plaque
      After that, your world is black
      You drop into a hole
      Your mold separates from your soul
      Behold, the Gravediggaz told you 'Beware'
      But you didn't listen
      So now we appear eardrums glisten, ha ha
    %p
      When I wreck I commence to detect
      Ready to dissect so come step alive and die
      Next murder is mayhem
      Diggin graves is a regular
      Treach-orous mangler
      Tha Boston Strangler
      Heated and trapped in a fury of hate
      Daredevil, the rhyme rebel my art terminates
      Subduin and pul-ver-i-zin ya head
      You bled, fell dead, and your tombstone read
      Rza-to-the-recta, Grym-to-the-reap
      Unda-to-the-taker, Gate-to-the-keep
      Creepin thru tha ghettos and the slums and streets
      Gravedigga, nigga, 6 feet
    %p
      Darkness shall fall upon y'all
      Who slept on the styles
      That crept thru tha door
      The grave behave we come to save
      So don't be afraid of the dark
      We spark like light in night
      Excite, excite is right, is right
      Come follow the light
      And see what I see and be what I be
      Tha G-to-the-R-to-the-A-to-the-V...E
    %p
      In the mind I come with the sparks from the attic
      Yet psychopathic brain tracks is tragic
      Twist lifting wrist like riff of a Taurus
      Deep in tha forest, I slay for tha porridge
      Yet it's cold, ya die slow like a tortoise
      Deep in my chorus, ya result Diggamortis
      Let me see I'm castin disease
      Contrary, yet some fairy cause ya bleed
