        There's a war going on outside, no man is safe from
        You could run but you can't hide forever
        From these, streets, that we done took
        You walking with your head down scared to look
        You shook, cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
        They never around when the beef cooks in my part of town
        It's similar to Vietnam
        Now we all grown up and old, and beyond the cop's control
        They better have the riot gear ready
        Tryin to bag me and get rocked steady
        By the mac one-double, I touch you
        And leave you with not much to go home with
        My skin is thick, cause I be up in the mix of action
        If I'm not at home, puffing lye relaxin
        New York got a nigga depressed
        So I wear a slug-proof underneath my Guess
        God bless my soul, before I put my foot down and begin to stroll
        And to the drama I built, and all unfinished beef
        You will soon be killed, put us together
        It's like mixing vodka and milk
        I'm goin out blasting, taking my enemies with me
        And if not, they scarred, so they will never forget me
        Lord forgive me the Hennesey got me not knowing how to act
        I'm falling and I can't turn back
        Or maybe it's the words from my man Killer Black
        That I can't say so it's left a untold fact, until my death
        My goal's to stay alive
        Survival of the fit only the strong survive.
      </p>

        I 'm trapped, in between two worlds, trying to get dough y'know
        When the dough get low the jewels go, but never that
        As long as fiends smoke crack
        I'll be on the block hustling counting my stacks
        No doubt, watchin my back and proceed with caution
        Five-oh lurking, no time to get lost in -- the system
        Niggas using fake names to get out quick
        My brother did it and got bagged with two ounces
        Illegal world where squads hit the block hard
        Ask my man Twin when he got bagged, that fucked me up God
        But shit happens for a reason
        You find out who's your true peoples when you're upstate bleeding
        You can't find a shorty to troop your bid with you
        Hit with a 2 to 4 it's difficult
        Wild on the streets I try to maintain
        Tight with my loot, cause hoes like to run game
        Some niggas like to trick but I ain't with that tricking shit
        I'm like a Jew, saving dough so I can big whip
        Pushing a Lex, now I'm set, ready to jet
        No matter how much loot I get I'm staying in the projects, forever
        Jakes on the blocks we out-clever
        If beef, we never separate and pull together
        When worse comes to worst, my peoples come first
        Try to react and get them motherfucking feelings hurt
        My crew's all about loot
        Fuck lookin cute, I'm strictly Timb boots and Army certified suits
        Puffin L's, laid back, enjoying the smell
        In the Bridge getting down it ain't hard to tell
        You better realize
      </p>
