      There's a war going on outside, no man is safe from
      You could run but you can't hide forever
      From these, streets, that we done took
      You walking with your head down scared to look
      You shook, cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
      They never around when the beef cooks in my part of town
      It's similar to Vietnam
      Now we all grown up and old, and beyond the cop's control
      They better have the riot gear ready
      Tryin to bag me and get rocked steady
      By the mac one-double, I touch you
      And leave you with not much to go home with
      My skin is thick, cause I be up in the mix of action
      If I'm not at home, puffing lye relaxin
      New York got a nigga depressed
      So I wear a slug-proof underneath my Guess
      God bless my soul, before I put my foot down and begin to stroll
      And to the drama I built, and all unfinished beef
      You will soon be killed, put us together
      It's like mixing vodka and milk
      I'm goin out blasting, taking my enemies with me
      And if not, they scarred, so they will never forget me
      Lord forgive me the Hennesey got me not knowing how to act
      I'm falling and I can't turn back
      Or maybe it's the words from my man Killer Black
      That I can't say so it's left a untold fact, until my death
      My goal's to stay alive
      Survival of the fit only the strong survive

      I'm trapped, in between two worlds, trying to get dough y'know
      When the dough get low the jewels go, but never that
      As long as fiends smoke crack
      I'll be on the block hustling counting my stacks
      No doubt, watchin my back and proceed with caution
      Five-oh lurking, no time to get lost in -- the system
      Niggas using fake names to get out quick
      My brother did it and got bagged with two ounces
      Illegal world where squads hit the block hard
      Ask my man Twin when he got bagged, that fucked me up God
      But shit happens for a reason
      You find out who's your true peoples when you're upstate bleeding
      You can't find a shorty to troop your bid with you
      Hit with a 2 to 4 it's difficult
      Wild on the streets I try to maintain
      Tight with my loot, cause hoes like to run game
      Some niggas like to trick but I ain't with that tricking shit
      I'm like a Jew, saving dough so I can big whip
      Pushing a Lex, now I'm set, ready to jet
      No matter how much loot I get I'm staying in the projects, forever
      Jakes on the blocks we out-clever
      If beef, we never separate and pull together
      When worse comes to worst, my peoples come first
      Try to react and get them motherfucking feelings hurt
      My crew's all about loot
      Fuck lookin cute, I'm strictly Timb boots and Army certified suits
      Puffin L's, laid back, enjoying the smell
      In the Bridge getting down it ain't hard to tell
      You better realize
    %p
      Look in the eyes and get wise
      Look alive, in ninety-five, word up
      Hypnotic thug life, get that ass paralyzed
      Knahmsayin? Mobb Deep and all that
