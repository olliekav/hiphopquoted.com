Hip-Hop Quoted
================

Source code for http://hiphopquoted.com. Built on http://middlemanapp.com

This site started out as a labour of love in 2008 to combine two of my loves in life, Hip-Hop and Typography/Design and explore some of the web's capabilities to do some interesting layouts. It was originally built in Wordpress but over time became quite difficult to manage and scale to my needs. By this time web fonts had become availble so I rebuilt it in Middleman as I love Ruby syntax.

I made this repo public so people can get some help with setting up this style of visual blog. Feel free to use the setup & code I've used to create your own personal projects, but please don't rip-off the design, it won't be hard to notice if you do!
